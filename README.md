# MacVRCRemote

Remote-control VRChat from your Mac.

## Why??

I like to co-work in VRChat on Vision Pro using ALVR and Mac Virtual Display, but the hand-tracking controls are unreliable and switching back & forth between keyboard/controllers to move around or mute/PTT while working is inconvenient. So here is a small macOS utility to do that from your keyboard, via OSC over the network.

This is not the most practical or economical setup, but it enables cross-platform immersive co-working with people around the world in thousands of beautiful environments, and now it's a bit more viable!

## Usage

1. Extract and run MacVRCRemote.app. Maybe move it to your Applications folder and add it to your Login Items.
2. Follow the prompt to grant Accessibility permissions to MacVRCRemote, and run it again. This is needed to listen for the keyboard shortcuts.
3. From the menu bar icon, open the Settings and input the host IP where VRChat is running. You can also choose which hand the Quick Menu opens on here.
4. That's it! Start VRChat on the host and refer to the controls below.
